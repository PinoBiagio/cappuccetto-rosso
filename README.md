# Cappuccetto Rosso
Project to learn Computer Science for 2Binf @ IIS Marconi Civitavecchia.

We use Processing for this project.

Note for english speaker: Cappuccetto Rosso is the Italian name of Little Red Riding Hood. We will use the name "Cappuccetto Rosso" (and sometime other Italian words) to facilitate understanding for Italian students.
